# App Planning Lab

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Make sure when you read back your work that you've written things clearly, so that anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable add screenshots, photos, and links.

1. You will also deploy an `index.html` page to GitHub pages.

## Instructions

You will be planning a new application to develop that will be a competitor for another popular application. Your goal is to determine the minimal functionality required so you can launch your app as soon as possible.

Choose from any popular app. It can be an app for anything:

Write the user stories below. Add more `>` for each user story or use `-` to make a list


#### Create a new board

Follow the format provided (name of board, the 5 lists etc.) in the reading.

- Add a minimum of 5 cards (front only) based on your user stories to `Backlog`.
- Add appropriate labels.

Provide a link to your board below.

> [https://trello.com/b/jDPIsel0/leisure-link]()

#### For one card, fill out more details, include:

- The business case
- Acceptance criteria
- Notes
- Resources

Move that card to the `Doing` list and assign yourself to it.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [https://trello.com/c/kjMacls9]()

#### Create one bug card.

Think back to a bug you had in a recent lab or project and do your best to model that example.
It can either be a bug you solved or that you didn't get a chance to solve.

It should include:

- A brief description of the bug.
- The expected behavior.
- The steps to reproduce.
- At least one resource.

Make sure to label it as a bug. Move the card to the `To Do` list.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

### Wireframes

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository.

1. Create a wireframe for the main page that shows an index view (on mobile).

> ![Index on mobile view]()

1. Create a wireframe for a wide desktop view for either the index view.

> ![Index on desktop view]()

1. Create a wireframe for the view that has a new form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view (on mobile).

> ![New view]()

## Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.

## Reflection

Write down three things that went well for you doing this lab.
 
 - The brainstorming of this product went very well for me and I was able to identify a problem that might have a solution.
 - Being able to list the many different user stories and see what an actual user would want from an app
 - Utilizing trello to disseminate the different tasks

Write down one thing you'd improve on for next time.

> One thing I would improve would be the layout for this product and exactly what products I would sell.
