# App Planning Lab

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Make sure when you read back your work that you've written things clearly, so that anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable add screenshots, photos, and links.

1. You will also deploy an `index.html` page to GitHub pages.

## Instructions

You will be planning a new application to develop that will be a competitor for another popular application. Your goal is to determine the minimal functionality required so you can launch your app as soon as possible.

Choose from any popular app. It can be an app for anything:

- Music
- TV/Videos
- Shopping
- Social media
- Blog
- Forum (like Stack Overflow or Reddit)
- Chat app
- Recipes
- Business reviews

## Questions

## Project Managing Tool

#### In 1-3 sentences describe your application.

A community driven second hand exchange / locator app, something similar to offerup or mercari except it wouldnt have items for sale on launch. It would be solely for people looking to give away furniture / find things of that nature.

#### What is the name of your application?

Neighborcould. An application to strengthen the ties that surround us, our neighbors.

#### Create a minimum of 10 user stories. Make sure to use the format:

- `As a <type of user>, I want to <some goal>, so that <some reason>.`

Write the user stories below. Add more `>` for each user story or use `-` to make a list

- `As a user on the platform I should be able to log in & have a search history enabled or disabled. Every website should have a login.`

- `A user should also be able to find items by name, filter by zip code, area state and etc. For ease of access to find the items they are in search of.`

- `We should be able to leave reviews of other users good or bad, and also report them if they violate ToS.`

- `As a user you should be able to save an item to come back to like a wishlist feature.`

- `A complete profile design so users can upload a photo and fill out more personal information they want to be public.`

- `Allow the users to be able to message one another, for better coordination.`

- `Give users updates on if the item is avaiable and if it is picked up give an update saying the item is no longer available.`

- `Allow users to create stories or updates on the items they want to give away, think of them as status updates.`

- `All users should be able to recieve badges and honor points for the reviews they are given.`

- `Sellers should be allowed to advertise their posts/listings. Give them a set amount of advertisement/boosted visablity above normal users.`

- `As a seller, we should be able to make a detailed listing with product descriptions and places to upload images.`

- `Allow the seller to make their listings auction-style, buy it full price or allow them to recieve offers.`

- `Give all accounts/users the ability to delete all their data from the app.`

#### Create a new board

Follow the format provided (name of board, the 5 lists etc.) in the reading.

- Add a minimum of 5 cards (front only) based on your user stories to `Backlog`.
- Add appropriate labels.

Provide a link to your board below.

#### For one card, fill out more details, include:

- The business case
- Acceptance criteria
- Notes
- Resources

Move that card to the `Doing` list and assign yourself to it.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [Detailed card](https://trello.com/c/fW62KlgB/4-app-summary-card)

#### Create one bug card.

Think back to a bug you had in a recent lab or project and do your best to model that example.
It can either be a bug you solved or that you didn't get a chance to solve.

It should include:

- A brief description of the bug.
- The expected behavior.
- The steps to reproduce.
- At least one resource.

Make sure to label it as a bug. Move the card to the `To Do` list.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [Bug card](https://trello.com/c/BH2ZTHV6/5-bug-card-1)

#### Create one chore card

Think back to a chore you had in a recent lab or project and model that example. Move the chore to the `Done` column.

- Assign yourself to it.
- Add a due date.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [Chore card](https://trello.com/c/HhGlovtt/6-chore-card-1)

### Wireframes

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository.

1. Create a wireframe for the main page that shows an index view (on mobile).

> ![Index on mobile view](https://wireframe.cc/nU8XJA)

1. Create a wireframe for a wide desktop view for either the index view.

> ![Index on desktop view](https://wireframe.cc/nU8XJA)

1. Create a wireframe for the view that has a new form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view (on mobile).

> ![New view](https://wireframe.cc/fFdkEs)

## Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.

## Reflection

Write down three things that went well for you doing this lab.
 
 - I think I did well creating a vision for the layouts of the pages.
 - I used the appropriate resources to make the app planning easier.
 - Learned how to better plan when creating an app.

Write down one thing you'd improve on for next time.

> One thing I'd improve... Is using these methods when creating all my projects.
