### Wireframes

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository.

1. Create a wireframe for the main page that shows an index view (on mobile).

> ![Index on mobile view](./app_plan_lab_imgs/SE_mobile_view_main_page_wireframe.png)

1. Create a wireframe for a wide desktop view for either the index view.

> ![Index on desktop view](./app_plan_lab_imgs/SE_wedpage_main_page_wireframe.png)

1. Create a wireframe for the view that has a new form (new user, new shipping information, new post, new song, new product etc.) view (on mobile).

> ![New view](./app_plan_lab_imgs/SE_mobile_view_enter_new_product_form.png)

## Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.

## Reflection

Write down three things that went well for you doing this lab.
 
 - one: Building out the wireframe cards as I got use to the wireframe systme was fun and rewarding as it gave me a visual idea of how I wanted to make this product look. 
 - two: The Trello cards after gaining some experience system was very helpful as it allowed me to have a scope of the project. It also allowed me to manage the pieces of the project into bit size pieces. 
 - three: 

Write down one thing you'd improve on for next time.

> One thing I'd improve is time management and the alottment of time which was given to this mini-project given the strenous time crutches I was under at the given time. Would have loved to give it more of the attention it needed.
