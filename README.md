# App Planning Lab

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. Make sure when you read back your work that you've written things clearly, so that anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable add screenshots, photos, and links.

1. You will also deploy an `index.html` page to GitHub pages.

## Instructions

You will be planning a new application to develop that will be a competitor for another popular application. Your goal is to determine the minimal functionality required so you can launch your app as soon as possible.

Choose from any popular app. It can be an app for anything:

- Music
- TV/Videos
- Shopping
- Social media
- Blog
- Forum (like Stack Overflow or Reddit)
- Chat app
- Recipes
- Business reviews

## Questions

## Project Managing Tool

#### In 1-3 sentences describe your application.

> My app will randomly generate character info for DnD.

#### What is the name of your application?

> DnD Character Creator

#### Create a minimum of 10 user stories. Make sure to use the format:

- `As a <type of user>, I want to <some goal>, so that <some reason>.` 

Write the user stories below. Add more `>` for each user story or use `-` to make a list

> 1. As a Dungeon Master, I want to quickly generate a random character's name, race, and class, so that I can easily populate my game world with diverse and interesting NPCs.

> 2. As a novice player, I want the app to provide a simplified character backstory along with the basic details, so that I can start playing without the need to create an elaborate history for my character.

> 3. As a player preparing for a one-shot campaign, I want the app to generate a unique set of abilities, skills, and equipment for my character, so that I can experience different aspects of the game in a short time.

> 4. As a storyteller, I want the app to offer options for character alignment and personality traits, so that I can create characters that fit seamlessly into the narrative of my campaign.

> 5. As a player interested in a challenge, I want the app to include options for generating characters with quirks or disadvantages, so that I can explore unique and difficult-to-play character concepts.

> 6. As a game master planning a long-term campaign, I want the app to provide detailed character backstories, including personal goals and motivations, so that I can weave these elements into the overarching plot.

> 7. As a player looking for variety, I want the app to allow me to customize the level and experience of the generated character, so that I can create characters at different power levels for various adventures.

> 8. As a player participating in a themed campaign, I want the app to offer settings and backgrounds that align with the campaign's theme, so that my character feels integrated into the game world.

> 9. As a Dungeon Master running a session on the fly, I want the app to quickly generate random encounters, complete with detailed characters, so that I can improvise scenarios without extensive preparation.

> 10. As a player, I want to be able to fill out some information about my character and also have the option to have the information selected for me, if I don't want to select the info on my own.

#### Create a new board

Follow the format provided (name of board, the 5 lists etc.) in the reading.

- Add a minimum of 5 cards (front only) based on your user stories to `Backlog`.
- Add appropriate labels.

Provide a link to your board below.

> [https://trello.com/b/vLw6U0CM/dnd-character-randomizer]()

#### For one card, fill out more details, include:

- The business case
- Acceptance criteria
- Notes
- Resources

Move that card to the `Doing` list and assign yourself to it.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [https://trello.com/c/397xxMaI]()

#### Create one bug card.

Think back to a bug you had in a recent lab or project and do your best to model that example.
It can either be a bug you solved or that you didn't get a chance to solve.

It should include:

- A brief description of the bug.
- The expected behavior.
- The steps to reproduce.
- At least one resource.

Make sure to label it as a bug. Move the card to the `To Do` list.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

> [https://trello.com/c/vehXiv0q]()

#### Create one chore card

Think back to a chore you had in a recent lab or project and model that example. Move the chore to the `Done` column.

- Assign yourself to it.
- Add a due date.

Provide a link to the specific card below.

### Wireframes

Create three wireframes. You may use a free online tool or draw them on paper (you can either scan them or use your phone to photograph them). You will upload them to this repository.

1. Create a wireframe for the main page that shows an index view (on mobile).

> ![https://wireframe.cc/uu6u3f]()

1. Create a wireframe for a wide desktop view for either the index view.

> ![https://wireframe.cc/R0aGrq]()


## Minimum Viable Product

Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file. Using your user stories and wireframes build the responsive `index` view. You should use `lorem ipsum` placeholder text and placeholder images, where applicable. The index view should have between 2 and 5 example resources.

Deploy this to GitHub pages.

## Reflection

Write down three things that went well for you doing this lab.
 
 - I was able to use Trello to make a plan for this app
 - Designing the website after making the wireframes felt easier than just trying to make website.
 - I was able to effectively implement an API in my code.

Write down one thing you'd improve on for next time.

> I will try to organize my thoughts better using Trello.
